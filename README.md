My codes regarding waveguide.
I used MATLAB to solve waveguide equations numerically. There are two equations that needs to be solved. The method used to approximate roots is bisection. The code to approximate the solution for the first equation is WaveGuidSolution1.m, while for the second one WaveGuideSolution2.m. The output of each code is the effective refrective index. In using bisection method, one needs to make a guessed interval on where the solution lies. This is possible my first making the code WaveGuideCurve.m to visualize the curve. After that, it's just about guessing the lower bound and the upper bound. You will see in the curve that there are odd solution and even solution. The curve for each can be generated with OddSolution.m and EvenSolution.m, respectively. The curve is E(x) vs. x, where x is in nanometres.
